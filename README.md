## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I'm Piotr, a seasoned software developer with over 20 years of experience. Despite my youthful appearance in photos, I've been in the industry for quite some time. I began my coding journey with early versions of Perl and PHP, which were a lot of fun. - (yes it was fun)

These days, I enjoy working with Node.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. However, I don't just see myself as a developer. My primary role is to unite large development teams and ensure a seamless development process. I also have a good understanding of cloud platforms like AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud. Hetzner, among others.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on

I am working on my "make the IaC world easy" project [deploy.my](https://deploy.my). 

Basically I wrote a translation module that translates `docker-compose.yml` into common Infrastructure as Code templates and makes it deployable with a one-click mechanism.

Translation module = [docker-to-iac](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deploymy/docker-to-iac) - Github: [https://github.com/deploymy/docker-to-iac](https://github.com/deploymy/docker-to-iac).

## âš¡ Fun fact

There is no fun fact about me. I grew up in Germany. Here in Germany, people work, they don't have fun! ðŸ˜„
