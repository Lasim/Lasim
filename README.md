## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my profile! I'm Piotr, a seasoned software developer with over 20 years of experience. Despite my youthful appearance in photos, I've been in the industry for quite some time. I began my coding journey with early versions of Perl and PHP, which were a lot of fun. - (yes it was fun)

These days, I enjoy working with Node.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. However, I don't just see myself as a developer. My primary role is to unite large development teams and ensure a seamless development process. I also have a good understanding of cloud platforms like AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud. Hetzner, among others.

I am working on [DeployStack](https://deploystack.io) - The Complete MCP Management Platform that scales from solo developers to enterprise teams.

DeployStack solves two critical MCP (Model Context Protocol) challenges: management chaos (credential sprawl, lack of governance) and context window crisis (token bloat from loading 150+ tools).

**Key innovations:**
- **Zero Installation**: Just add one URL to VS Code settings - no CLI installation required
- **Hierarchical Router**: 2 meta-tools (`discover_mcp_tools`, `execute_mcp_tool`) reduce token consumption by 98.3%
- **Dual Deployment**: Global Satellites (managed, freemium) or Team Satellites (self-hosted with Docker)
- **Control Plane**: [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) - Centralized credential vault, team management, and MCP server catalog

Main repository: [deploystackio/deploystack](https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack)

## ⚡ Fun fact

There is no fun fact about me. I grew up in Germany. Here in Germany, people work, they don't have fun! 😄
