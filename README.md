## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I'm Piotr, a seasoned software developer with over 20 years of experience. Despite my youthful appearance in photos, I've been in the industry for quite some time. I began my coding journey with early versions of Perl and PHP, which were a lot of fun. - (yes it was fun)

These days, I enjoy working with Node.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. However, I don't just see myself as a developer. My primary role is to unite large development teams and ensure a seamless development process. I also have a good understanding of cloud platforms like AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud. Hetzner, among others.

I am working on [DeployStack](https://deploystack.io) - The Complete MCP Management Platform that scales from solo developers to enterprise teams.

DeployStack solves MCP (Model Context Protocol) complexity by eliminating credential management hell, reducing onboarding friction from days to minutes, and providing organizational visibility into AI tool usage. We turn MCP from "too complex to adopt" into "too easy not to use."

**Key components:**
- **Control Plane**: [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) - Centralized credential vault, team management, and MCP server catalog
- **Data Plane**: DeployStack Gateway - Local secure proxy that provides zero-configuration access to all team-authorized MCP tools
- **Architecture**: Hybrid SSE + stdio system with persistent process management for instant tool availability

Main repository: [deploystackio/deploystack](https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack)

## âš¡ Fun fact

There is no fun fact about me. I grew up in Germany. Here in Germany, people work, they don't have fun! ðŸ˜„
